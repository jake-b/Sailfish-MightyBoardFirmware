/* LiquidCrystalSerial_I2C
 *
 * This is an implementation of communciation routines for a
 * HD44780-based LCD display connected to an I2C bus expander/extender
 *
 * Bus extenders/expanders of this type may have their I/O pins connected
 * to the HD44780 in different ways depending on the implementation of
 * the hardare.  This mapping is done in below  in the preprocessor
 * defintions, and should be modified as necessary for the specific
 * hardware in use.
